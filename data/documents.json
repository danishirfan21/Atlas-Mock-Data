    "body": "<p>This document provides comprehensive guidelines for integrating with our REST API endpoints. Whether you're building internal tools or partner integrations, following these best practices will ensure secure, reliable, and performant connections.</p><p>Our API follows industry-standard REST principles and uses JSON for request and response payloads. All endpoints require authentication via API keys or OAuth 2.0 tokens, depending on your use case and security requirements.</p><p>Authentication flows are designed to balance security with developer experience. For server-to-server integrations, we recommend using API keys with appropriate scoping. For user-facing applications, OAuth 2.0 provides the flexibility needed for delegated access while maintaining user privacy and control.</p><p>Rate limiting is enforced at the account level with different tiers available based on your subscription plan. Standard accounts receive 1,000 requests per hour, while enterprise customers can request higher limits through our support team. All rate limit information is included in response headers.</p><p>Error handling follows HTTP status code conventions. The API returns detailed error messages in JSON format to help with debugging. Common errors include authentication failures (401), insufficient permissions (403), and rate limit exceeded (429).</p>",

This document synthesizes key findings and strategic recommendations for the upcoming quarter.</p><p>The competitive landscape has shifted significantly with three major players launching AI-powered features. Our analysis indicates that customers are willing to pay premium prices for intelligent automation, but expect seamless integration with existing workflows.</p><p>User interviews revealed consistent pain points around data synchronization and mobile accessibility. Teams spending more than 4 hours weekly on manual data entry are showing highest churn risk. Our proposed solutions focus on automated sync and progressive web app capabilities.</p><p>Market opportunity analysis suggests a 40% TAM expansion if we successfully execute on enterprise collaboration features. Early adopter programs with 5 strategic accounts are scheduled to begin in late October.</p><p>Resource allocation recommendations include doubling the mobile team and establishing a dedicated AI/ML research group. Budget requirements and hiring plans are detailed in the appendix.</p>",

    "body": "<p>This synthesis covers findings from 24 user interviews and 12 moderated usability testing sessions conducted between November 15-30. Participants included both power users and occasional users across different team sizes and industries.</p><p>The primary insight is that users value speed over feature completeness in mobile contexts. 89% of participants reported using the mobile app exclusively for quick lookups and status updates, not for creating new content or complex workflows.</p><p>Usability testing revealed significant friction in the document search experience. Users expected search results to appear instantly and were frustrated by the current 2-3 second delay. Most participants abandoned searches that took longer than 3 seconds.</p><p>Navigation patterns showed heavy reliance on recent items and favorites. Very few users explored the full navigation menu. This suggests opportunities to streamline the information architecture and surface relevant content more proactively.</p><p>Recommendations include implementing instant search with client-side filtering, redesigning the home screen to prioritize recents and favorites, and simplifying the navigation structure to focus on core use cases.</p>",

Single sign-on (SSO) integration is required for third-party tools handling customer data. Legacy systems have until March 2025 to complete migration.</p><p>Data encryption standards have been updated to require AES-256 for data at rest and TLS 1.3 for data in transit. Database backups must be encrypted separately with keys stored in approved key management systems.</p><p>Code review requirements now mandate security-focused review for any changes touching authentication, authorization, or data access layers. Automated security scanning must pass before pull requests can be merged.</p><p>Incident response procedures include new notification requirements and escalation paths. All security incidents must be logged in the central tracking system within 1 hour of discovery, regardless of severity.</p>",

Offline mode has been added to the Q1 roadmap based on this feedback.</p><p>Bug reports clustered around three main areas: sync conflicts in collaborative editing, occasional search index staleness, and notification reliability issues. Engineering has prioritized sync conflict resolution for the January release.</p><p>Customer satisfaction scores averaged 4.2/5, down slightly from November's 4.4/5. The decrease correlates with the collaborative editing rollout and associated performance issues. Satisfaction is expected to recover as performance improvements ship.</p><p>Notable positive feedback highlighted the new command palette and keyboard shortcuts. Multiple customers mentioned these features significantly improved their daily workflows and reduced reliance on mouse navigation.</p>",
